🟢 Sliding Window Master Set
SECTION 1: Beginner – Fixed Size Window
Q1. Maximum sum of subarray of size k
arr = [2,1,5,1,3,2]
k = 3
# Output: 9  → [5,1,3]

Q2. Minimum sum of subarray of size k
arr = [2,1,5,1,3,2]
k = 2
# Output: 2 → [1,1]

Q3. Average of all subarrays of size k
arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
k = 2
# Output: [1.5,2.5,3.5,4.5]

Q4. Count of subarrays of size k with sum = target
arr = [1,2,1,1,2]
k = 2
target = 3
# Output: 3 → [1,2],[2,1],[1,2]

SECTION 2: Intermediate – Variable Size Window
Q5. Longest substring with at most k distinct characters
s = "eceba"
k = 2
# Output: 3 → "ece"

Q6. Longest substring with all unique characters
s = "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3 → "abc"

Q7. Count of subarrays with sum ≤ k
arr = [1,2,3,4]
k = 5
# Output: 6 → [1],[2],[3],[4],[1,2],[2,3]

Q8. Smallest subarray with sum ≥ s
arr = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
s = 7
# Output: 2 → [4,3]

SECTION 3: Advanced – Maximum/Minimum in Window
Q9. Maximum in every sliding window of size k
arr = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7]
k = 3
# Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]

Q10. Minimum in every sliding window of size k
arr = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7]
k = 3
# Output: [-1,-3,-3,-3,3,3]

Q11. Maximum sum of subarray with size ≤ k
arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
k = 3
# Output: 12 → [3,4,5]

Q12. Count of subarrays with exactly k distinct integers
arr = [1,2,1,2,3]
k = 2
# Output: 7

SECTION 4: Sliding Window + HashMap / Dictionary
Q13. Longest substring without repeating characters
s = "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3 → "abc"

Q14. Longest substring with exactly k unique characters
s = "aabbcc"
k = 2
# Output: 4 → "aabb" or "bbcc"

Q15. Count number of anagrams of p in s
s = "cbaebabacd"
p = "abc"
# Output: [0,6]

Q16. Minimum window substring containing all characters of t
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
# Output: "BANC"

SECTION 5: Two Pointer + Sliding Window
Q17. Longest subarray with sum ≤ k
arr = [3,1,2,1,1]
k = 4
# Output: 3 → [1,2,1] or [2,1,1]

Q18. Longest subarray with at most k zero flips
arr = [1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0]
k = 2
# Output: 6 → flip two zeros to get longest 1's subarray

Q19. Maximum consecutive ones after at most k flips
arr = [1,0,1,0,1,1,0]
k = 1
# Output: 4

Q20. Subarray product less than k
arr = [10,5,2,6]
k = 100
# Output: 8 → a
