🟢 Two Pointer Master Set
SECTION 1: Beginner – Basic Two Pointers
Q1. Two Sum in Sorted Array
arr = [1,2,3,4,6]
target = 6
# Output: (1,3) → 2+4=6


Hint: Left pointer at start, right pointer at end, move pointers based on sum.

Q2. Reverse a List in Place
arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [5,4,3,2,1]


Hint: Swap arr[left] and arr[right] until pointers meet.

Q3. Check Palindrome String
s = "racecar"
# Output: True


Hint: Compare s[left] and s[right].

Q4. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (In-place)
arr = [1,1,2,2,3]
# Output: [1,2,3]


Hint: Slow pointer for writing, fast pointer for scanning.

SECTION 2: Intermediate – Sum & Pair Problems
Q5. Count Pairs with Sum = k
arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
k = 5
# Output: 2 → (1,4),(2,3)


Array is sorted.

Q6. Two Sum II – Input array is sorted
arr = [2,7,11,15]
target = 9
# Output: [1,2] (1-based indices)

Q7. Move Zeros to End
arr = [0,1,0,3,12]
# Output: [1,3,12,0,0]


Hint: Slow pointer for writing non-zero values.

Q8. Square of a Sorted Array
arr = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
# Output: [0,1,9,16,100]


Hint: Compare absolute values from both ends.

SECTION 3: Advanced – Subarray Problems
Q9. Container With Most Water
height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
# Output: 49


Hint: Left & right pointers, calculate area, move smaller height pointer.

Q10. Trapping Rain Water
height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
# Output: 6


Hint: Two pointers from both ends with max heights.

Q11. 3Sum (Sorted Array or After Sorting)
arr = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
# Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]


Hint: Fix first element, use two pointers for remaining two.

Q12. Move All Negative Numbers to One Side
arr = [1,-2,3,-4,5]
# Output: [-2,-4,1,3,5]


Hint: Two pointers from both ends.

SECTION 4: String / Pattern Two Pointer
Q13. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
s = "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3 → "abc"


Hint: Use sliding window + two pointers.

Q14. Minimum Window Substring
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
# Output: "BANC"


Hint: Left & right pointer for window, hashmap to count chars.

Q15. Valid Palindrome with At Most One Removal
s = "abca"
# Output: True → remove 'c'


Hint: Two pointers from ends, allow one mismatch.

Q16. Reverse Words in a String (In-place)
s = "the sky is blue"
# Output: "blue is sky the"


Hint: Two pointers + reverse individual words first, then whole string.

SECTION 5: Array / Sum Variations
Q17. Triplet Sum Closest
arr = [-1,2,1,-4]
target = 1
# Output: 2 → sum = -1 + 2 + 1 = 2

Q18. Pair with Smallest Difference
arr1 = [1,3,15,11,2]
arr2 = [23,127,235,19,8]
# Output: (11,8) → difference = 3


Hint: Sort both, two pointers.

Q19. Dutch National Flag Problem
arr = [0,1,2,0,1,2]
# Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]


Hint: Low, mid, high pointers.

Q20. Merge Two Sorted Arrays In-Place
arr1 = [1,3,5,0,0,0]
arr2 = [2,4,6]
# Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]


Hint: Start filling from end using two pointers.

💡 Patterns to Remember:

Two pointers from start & end → max/min problems, container, trapping water

Two pointers for sorted array → sum, difference, pair problems

Two pointers + sliding window → substring, subarray, unique characters

Three pointers / multiple pointers → 3Sum, 3Sum closest

In-place swap → partitioning arrays or strings
